Didn’t it happen that sometimes you forgot about 👼🏻 or 😈 behavior of your kids and later, at “that” moment when you wanted to take proper decision but you forgot and it wasn’t the best one? To me it definitely happened, so I decided to write small app to help parents like me to have tract of behavior of their kids.

…in later phase of development I’ll add some more info and screenshots.
